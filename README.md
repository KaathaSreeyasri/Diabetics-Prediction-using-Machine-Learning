# Diabetics-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Abstract: The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning algorithms(comparitive study). By leveraging the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset sourced from Kaggle, various classification algorithms were implemented, and their performance was compared. Random Forest emerged as the most accurate algorithm, highlighting its robustness in handling structured healthcare data.
Dataset Description: The dataset consists of 768 observations and 8 features, including:
     Pregnancies
     Glucose level
     Blood pressure
     Skin thickness
     Insulin
     BMI (Body Mass Index)
     Diabetes pedigree function (family history)
     Age
The target variable is a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
Methodology:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
	Data cleaning and handling of missing values.
	Feature scaling to standardize the data.
2.	Algorithms Implemented:
	Decision Tree
	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	Random Forest
	Logistic Regression
	Naive Bayes
3.	Performance_Metrics:
        Accuracy was used as the primary metric for comparison.
4.	Implementation:
        The models were implemented using Python, with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization.

Results: Each algorithm's performance was evaluated, and Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy. This can be attributed to its ensemble nature, which reduces overfitting and handles feature interactions effectively.
